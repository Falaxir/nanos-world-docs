How to setup your nanos world server using a Game Panel!

:::caution

The use of Game Panels is not officially supported and currently maintained by the community! The following steps are WIP and may change at any time! Please check the following GitHub repositories for updated information!

:::

Currently nanos world is supported on 2 games panel: [Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io) and [AMP (Application Management Panel)](https://cubecoders.com/AMP).

Sources and installation files are open source at Falaxir GitHub: https://github.com/Falaxir/nanos-world_yolks-game-panels. You can also check which features are supported.

## Pterodactyl Installation

Configuration and installation of this panel can be quite complex, we recommand you read the instructions fully before proceeding.

More information can be read at [their website](https://pterodactyl.io/)

### Requirements

- Latest linux OS
    - Ubuntu, Debian, others os may require extra work
- Dedicated server (no virtualisation) or Virtual machine (including VPS) using KVM virtualisation (OpenVZ is incompatible)
    - You can check with the linux command `hostnamectl`, it will be written under "Virtualization"

If you haven't installed the panel yet, we recommend using the unofficial [pterodactyl-installer available on github](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer).

### Installing the game server

Custom unofficial game servers can be installed in Pterodactyl panel as an `"egg"` with a `.json` file

The list of eggs can be found on the [installation github under the folder pterodactyl-egg](https://github.com/Falaxir/nanos-world_yolks-game-panels/tree/master/pterodactyl-egg). You can choose and download between two versions :
- egg-nanos-world-server.json
    - Stable branch of nanos world server
- egg-nanos-world-server-BLEEDING-EDGE.json
    - Bleeding edge branch for latest features before they are stable

To install theses files, go to your panel `Admin` page then click on the `NESTS` button (under the category `SERVICE MANAGEMENT`).

Create a new `NEST` by clicking the `Create New` button and give it any name you want.

After the nest is created, go back to the `NESTS` page and click on the button `Import EGG`, select the .json file you downloaded earlier and on the dropdown menu, select the nest you created earlier.

### Configuring nanos server

Most configuration can be edited on the main nanos world config file `Config.toml` available on the `Files` category on the panel

:::caution

Parameters such as Query Port, Announce, Max Players, Map => can only be edited in the `Startup` category on the panel. If these values are changed on config file, they will be overwritten !
