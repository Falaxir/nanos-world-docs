All you need to know about Assets

**Assets** in nanos world are all objects or content which come from Unreal Engine. For example _Maps_, _StaticMeshes_, _SkeletalMeshes_, _Sounds_, _Particles_, _Blueprints_ etc are all types of **Assets**.

In order to use custom Assets in your servers, for example to spawn a Prop, or a custom Weapon you must have an **Asset Pack**. Asset Packs are a set of Assets that were exported together from Unreal.


## Folder Structure

All Asset Packs go under the server's `Assets/` directory. Each Asset Pack is a folder under that.

:::info Note

Asset Packs downloaded when connecting to servers or downloaded from the vault will be stored in server's `Assets/` directory as well!

:::

This is an example of a server Assets folder:

```folder-structure title="Server Folder"
NanosWorldServer.exe
Assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-asset-pack-01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MyAsset_01.uasset
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MyAsset_02.uasset
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MyBigMap.umap
â”‚   â”‚    ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Assets.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ awesome-weapons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BigFuckingGun.uasset
â”‚   â”‚   ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Assets.toml
Packages/
Config.toml
```

## Assets Pack Configuration

Asset Packs have a configuration file in the root of the Asset Pack folder, called `Assets.toml`, in this file we can setup all pertinent settings related to the Asset Pack:

```toml reference
https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-server/blob/main/Assets.toml
```


### Settings Detailed

See a description of what each setting does:

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`title`** | Friendly name |
| **`author`** | Contributor(s) |
| **`version`** | Version - in the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) format `X.Y.Z` |
| **`unreal.unreal_folder`** | Name of the root folder in the Unreal Project which exported this Assets. This is important so the Assets can keep the relative references correctly |
| **`unreal.unreal_version`** | Version at which this Asset Pack was created |
| **`unreal.is_plugin_content`** | If this Asset Pack is Plugin Content |
| **`assets.maps`** | List of Maps in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.static_meshes`** | List of Static Meshes in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.skeletal_meshes`** | List of Skeletal Meshes in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.sounds`** | List of Sounds in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.animations`** | List of Animations in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.particles`** | List of Particles in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.materials`** | List of Materials in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.blueprints`** | List of Blueprints in this Asset Pack |
| **`assets.others`** | List of other Assets in this Asset Pack |


### Asset Meta Data

It is possible to define custom Meta Data for each individual Asset!

Besides defining the Asset Path by string, like this:

```toml title="Assets.toml"
[assets.static_meshes]
	SM_Flower_01 = "MyFolder/SM_Awesome_Flower_01"
	SM_Rock_01 = "MyFolder/SM_Rock_01"
	SM_MyAsset_01 = "MyFolder/SM_MyAsset_01"
	# ...
```

We can also define them as a table, allowing custom values - which can be accessed through scripting:

```toml title="Assets.toml"
[assets.static_meshes]
	SM_Flower_01 = { path = "MyFolder/SM_Awesome_Flower_01", my_tag = "Wonderful", something = 123, thumbnail = "Thumbnails/SM_Flower_01.jpg" }
	SM_Rock_01 = { path = "MyFolder/SM_Rock_01", my_tag = "Wonderful", something = 123, thumbnail = "Thumbnails/SM_Rock_01.jpg" }
	SM_MyAsset_01 = { path = "MyFolder/SM_MyAsset_01", my_tag = "Wonderful", something = 123, thumbnail = "Thumbnails/SM_MyAsset_01.jpg" }
	# ...
```

:::tip

The `path` key is required, all other values are optional and customizable, use as you wish!

## Logo Image

It is possible to have a custom image to be displayed in the Vault. For that, add a file called `Assets.jpg` besides the Assets.toml with the image you wish. The recommended size is `300x150`.


## Referencing Assets in Scripting

To be able to use Assets in your code, first you have to ensure that the Asset Pack is loaded. An Asset Pack is loaded when:

1. A map is loaded (this will make it's Asset Pack to be loaded automatically).
2. A package with it configured in `assets_requirements` is loaded.
3. It is manually set in Server's `Config.toml` at `assets` to load.

With the Asset Pack loaded, you can refer to it's assets using the following pattern:

`"[ASSET_PACK_PATH]::[ASSET_KEY]"`

Example:

`"my-asset-pack-01::SM_Cube"`

:::info note

`[ASSET_PACK_PATH]` is the folder name and `[ASSET_KEY]` is the key defined in the `Assets.toml`.

:::


## Types of Assets

Some scripting methods require some specific Type of Assets to load. Attempting to load an invalid or wrong type will cause an Error. E.g.: `Character:SetMesh()` requires an Asset of type `Skeletal Mesh`.

Here's a list of all supported Asset types:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Map** | An Unreal Engine Map/Level |
| **Static Mesh** | Unreal Static Meshes can be used to load meshes for Props and StaticMeshes |
| **Skeletal Mesh** | Unreal Skeletal Meshes can be used to load meshes for Characters and Vehicles |
| **Sound** | Unreal Sounds to load Sounds |
| **Particle** | Unreal Particles can be used for settings in several entities, including Particle Class itself |
| **Animation** | Unreal Animations can be used for settings in Character and Weapons |
| **Material** | Unreal Materials can be used for customizing meshes surfaces and used as Post Process |
| **Blueprint** | Unreal Actor Blueprints can be used for spawning Blueprint entities |


## Creating your own Assets

## Default Asset Pack

nanos world provides a default  Asset Pack which is already included in the base game. Please refer to the Default Asset Pack page for more information.
