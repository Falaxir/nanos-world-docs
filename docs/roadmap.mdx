How to submit new Ideas, report Bugs and check our Roadmap.

nanos world is a feedback-driven game, that means we are always listening to community feedback and ideas to follow a development path!


## Reporting Bugs

Our official channel for bug tracking is our **Github Issue Tracker**. All bugs reported there get a special attention and is resolved as soon as possible.
