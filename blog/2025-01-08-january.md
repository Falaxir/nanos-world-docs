**Unreal Engine 5.5 & Enhanced Input System!**

![](/img/blog/2023-january/january-news.webp)

Welcome to our roundup of the latest updates from the last months!

<!--truncate-->


## Unreal Engine 5.5

![](/img/blog/2025-january/ue55.webp)

Although it may feel like just yesterday that we transitioned to 5.4, we decided that we should already upgrade to **5.5** instead of waiting several months for the next 5.6. So we've already started preparing for the transition to Unreal Engine 5.5 and are quite ready for the update!

However, after several testing, we've decided to hold off until hotfix **5.5.2** is released. The current version (5.5.1) has some known issues, particularly with packaging and user-generated content which are already being addressed by Epic in their [Bug Tracker](https://issues.unrealengine.com/issue/UE-228884).

Once they release this hotfix, we'll move forward with the update and allow more space for broad tests with you!


## Enhanced Input System

We have finally implemented the new Unreal's [Enhanced Input System](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine)!

<MediaLegend>Input Keybinding Settings reworked to handle Unreal's Enhanced Input System</MediaLegend>

This required a significant internal overhaul of all our gameplay classes (characters, vehicles, weapons, and menu interactions), which will reset all current configurations.

Please make sure to revisit your keybinding settings and adjust them to your preference after this update is launched!


### Scripting Changes

If you were binding to native key bindings, you will need to update your scripts. With the new Enhanced Input System, each Keybinding is now separated in a different name.

Before we registered like this:

```lua title="Client/Input.lua"
Input.Bind("MoveForward", InputEvent.Pressed, function(delta)
	-- Before it returned delta from -1.0 (backwards) to 1.0 (forward)
	Console.Log("MoveForward: ", delta)
end)
```

Now each Input returns delta from 0.0 - 1.0, meaning just the amount pressed, and we need to Bind for each KeyBinding specifically.

This way, `MoveForward` (W) is just for moving forward, `MoveBackward` (S) is just for moving backwards:

```lua title="Client/Input.lua"
Input.Bind("MoveForward", InputEvent.Pressed, function(delta)
	-- Now it returns delta from 0.0 to 1.0
	Console.Log("MoveForward: ", delta)
end)

Input.Bind("MoveBackward", InputEvent.Pressed, function(delta)
	-- Now it returns delta from 0.0 to 1.0
	Console.Log("MoveBackward: ", delta)
end)
```

:::tip

You can find the exact Binding Name for the native bindings at the KeyBindings settings, by hovering them:

## Disconnected Popup

We added a new **Retry** button when you are disconnected from a server, to allow fast reconnection:

## Cache Files Location

Logs, cache images, cache packages and other temporary files are now stored in the **AppData** directory instead of the game installation directory.

This change resolves issues with restricted directories for non-admin users and centralizes all disposable files for easier management.

We've also updated your House Keeping menu to address the correct new paths.

As some of you asked, we've enabled the following plugins to be used by your UGC: **PoseSearch**, **AnimationWarping**, **MotionWarping** and **Chooser**.
