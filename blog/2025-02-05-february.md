**New Profiling Tools & Better Interpolation!**

![](/img/blog/2023-february/february-news.webp)

Welcome to our roundup of the latest updates from the last month!

<!--truncate-->


## Unreal Engine 5.5

![](/img/blog/2025-january/ue55.webp)

Epic has finally released the long-awaited hotfix **5.5.2** for Unreal! And in the **1.71.0** update, nanos world has been updated to Unreal 5.5 as well!

The Steam branch `bleeding-edge` is now running on 5.5, while `main` remains on 5.4 for now. We strongly recommend that you update your assets as soon as possible to ensure compatibility!


## New Profiling Tools

We've introduced several new features and improvements to our profiling toolset!


### Network Stats

We've implemented a new profiling feature that displays the amount of network data being used per class during a game session:

<MediaLegend>Client Network Stats displaying accumulated bytes usage per class in this session</MediaLegend>

On the server side, a debug message will be output every minute, providing details on the number of bytes sent and received:

<MediaLegend>Server Profiling displaying Network stats over the last minute</MediaLegend>

To enable this feature on the client, toggle both `profiling` and `display network stats in the screen` settings.

For the server, start it with the `--profiling` command-line flag.


### Network Invokes

By enabling in-game profiling, you can now view the time spent on individual class methods being called:

<MediaLegend>Client Profiling Network on Screen now displays Network Invokes times</MediaLegend>


## Network Interp Stutters

Recent Unreal updates caused issues with network interpolation in poor connection scenarios. Every packet loss or small delay resulted in visible stutters or hitches, as shown in the video below:

<MediaLegend>Old Interpolation with occasional packet loss, causing stutters/hitches</MediaLegend>

We have significantly improved the client-side interpolation/extrapolation system, preventing these stutters even on weak connections:

<VideoExternal path="/blog/2025-february/interp-after.webm" />

<MediaLegend>New Interpolation with packet loss but no stutters/hitches</MediaLegend>

This improvement currently applies to character movement. We plan to revisit interpolation for physics-based objects soonâ„¢.


## Cached Vault API

We have implemented an experimental cache system for our Vault, as we know that it's currently extremely slow to load the Vault assets, so we implemented an intermediary cache system that speeds a lot the Vault requests:

<VideoExternal path="/blog/2025-february/vault-api.webm" />

<MediaLegend>Vault Loading time reduced down to a second</MediaLegend>

:::note

As this is a cache system, the results are internally updated at a frequent rate, expect some seconds delay when updating your content in the Vault and seeing it in game.

## Docs Improvements

### Server Installation

We've updated our [Server Installation](/docs/next/core-concepts/server-manual/server-installation) page with revised minimal OS requirements for setting up a nanos world server on Linux.


### API References Pop-up

We've enhanced our documentation with a new component that displays detailed method and event information when hovering over them, improving tutorials and examples:

- **Method Reference** example: <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Actor" method="SetLocation" is_base show_class_name />.
- **Event Reference** example: <EventReference type="Class" class_name="Entity" event="Destroy" is_base />.


## New Assets Thumbnails

We've refreshed all asset thumbnails photos and fixed missing ones:

<MediaLegend>Sandbox Spawn Menu with all thumbnails updated</MediaLegend>


## Loading Screen Improvs

#### Async Callbacks

The "waiting for async callbacks" step now displays the number of pending tasks:

#### Smooth Progress

Also, now the progress bars update smoothly instead of jumping between values.


## Updated Dependencies

We've updated our internal dependencies to ensure stability and performance:

- **CEF** updated to version `132`.
- **Ultra Dynamic Sky** Plugin updated to version `8.6` - make sure to update yours too.


## Enabled Plugins

We've enabled the **MotionTrajectory** plugin for use in your UGC projects.


## Conclusion

Hope you enjoyed this month's updates!

I'm working on putting together a clearer development roadmap and restructuring some parts of the project to make everything run even smoother. Exciting things are on the horizon, and I can't wait to share more soon!

Big thanks to all of you for your continued support and feedback. It really keeps me motivated. Stay tuned for more awesome updates next month!
