:::tip

If your Actor Blueprint was spawned on the Server, it will be automatically synchronized with other players using the nanos world Network Authority system! It follows the same rules as all other entities!

:::note

Currently it is only possible to communicate in one-way with the Blueprint (Scripting -> Blueprint). We didn't find a way to have the inverse communication *(hopefully)* yet.
