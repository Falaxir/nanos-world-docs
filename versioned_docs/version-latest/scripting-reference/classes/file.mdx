:::info

It is not possible to open files from outside the server folder. All path must be relative to the Server's executable folder. All files are opened as binary file by default.

:::


## 🎒 Examples

```lua
local configuration_file = File("my_awesome_configuration.json")

local configuration_file_json = JSON.parse(configuration_file:Read())
```


## 📂 File Access & Sandboxing

Access to files is sandboxed. Only certain directories and files are allowed to be written or read from.


#### Server Side

On Server side, it's only allowed to access files inside the server folder itself (where server executable is located). Also, accessing the Config.toml is not allowed.

The default directory is where the server executable is located.

Example accessing a file from a Package: `Packages/My-Package/Server/MyFile.json`.


#### Client Side

On the client side, we have the concept of the `.transient/` folder which is a folder automatically generated inside the client's cached `Packages/` folder, where files can be created in a more persistent way.

It's not allowed to access files outside the client's cache folder `Packages/`, and write access is only permitted inside the `.transient/` folder itself.

The default directory is in the client's cached `Packages/.transient/` folder.

Example accessing a file from a Package (with ready-only access): `../my-package/Client/MyFile.json`.

Example accessing a transient file (with write access): `MyFile.json`.
