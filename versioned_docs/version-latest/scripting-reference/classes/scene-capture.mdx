## 🎒 Examples

```lua
-- Client Side
local scene_capture = SceneCapture(
  Vector(-900, 185, 215),
  Rotator(0, 90, 90),
  256,
  256,
  0.033,
  5000,
  100
)

my_prop:SetMaterialFromSceneCapture(scene_capture)
```

:::tip

You can use the output Texture from a SceneCapture with [:SetMaterialFromSceneCapture()](/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable.mdx#setmaterialfromscenecapture) method!

## 🏗️ Constructor

<ConstructorDeclaration type="Class" name="SceneCapture" />

:::note

Scene Captures capture a scene in real time, this means every tick it will re-render the scene from scratch. Please consider reducing the `width`/`height` and even the `render_rate` to improve it's performance.

We've worked hard to make SceneCapture as performatic as possible! Some techniques were applied for optimization and reducing the `render_rate` automatically when you are far and when the generated texture is out of the screen.
