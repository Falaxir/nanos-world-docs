## üéí¬†Examples

```lua title="Client/Index.lua"
	-- Gets the local player
	local local_player = Client.GetLocalPlayer()

	-- Gets the camera rotation and location
	local camera_rotation = local_player:GetCameraRotation()
	local start_location = local_player:GetCameraLocation()

	-- Calculates the direction vector based on the camera rotation
	local direction =  camera_rotation:GetForwardVector()

	-- Calculates the end location of the trace
	-- (start location + 20000 units in the direction of the camera)
	local end_location = start_location + direction * 20000

	-- Filter everything we want to trace (e.g. WorldStatic, WorldDynamic, PhysicsBody, Vehicle)
	local collision_trace = CollisionChannel.WorldStatic | CollisionChannel.WorldDynamic | CollisionChannel.PhysicsBody | CollisionChannel.Vehicle

	-- Define the parameters for the trace
	-- TraceMode.TraceOnlyVisibility means we only want to trace against objects that are visible
	-- TraceMode.DrawDebug means we want to draw debug lines for the trace for visualization
	-- TraceMode.TraceComplex means we want to trace against complex collision shapes
	-- TraceMode.ReturnEntity means we want to return the entity that was hit by the trace
	local trace_mode = TraceMode.TraceOnlyVisibility | TraceMode.DrawDebug | TraceMode.TraceComplex | TraceMode.ReturnEntity

	-- Do the trace
	local trace_result = Trace.LineSingle(start_location, end_location, collision_trace, trace_mode)

	-- If the trace was successful
	if (trace_result.Success) then
		-- And we got an entity, print the name of the collided entity, otherwise just print the location
		if (trace_result.Entity) then
			Console.Log("Trace Success! Entity: " .. trace_result.Entity:GetClass():GetName() .. ". Location: " .. tostring(trace_result.Location))
		else
			Console.Log("Trace Success! Location: " .. tostring(trace_result.Location))
		end
	else
		-- If the trace was not successful, print a message
		Console.Log("Failed to trace")
	end
