How to display information on the Screen to the Player.

In nanos world there are 3 official ways of plotting screen data: [WebUI](#webui), [Widget](#widget) and [Canvas](#canvas).


## WebUI

With <Classes.WebUI /> you can load HTML pages which integrate with your Packages in Lua using Events.

This sample code shows how to add a basic page using HTML+JavaScript with the WebUI Class:

```lua title="my-package/Client/Index.lua"
-- Spawns a WebUI with the HTML file you just created
MyUI = WebUI("My UI", "file://UI/index.html")

-- When the HTML is ready, triggers an Event in there
MyUI:Subscribe("Ready", function()
    MyUI:CallEvent("MyAwesomeEvent", "Hello! You are ready!")
end)

MyUI:Subscribe("MyAwesomeAnswer", function(param1)
    Console.Log("Received an answer! Message: " .. param1)
end)
```

```html title="my-package/Client/UI/index.html"
<html>
    <head>
        <script>
			// Register for "MyAwesomeEvent" from Lua
			Events.Subscribe("MyAwesomeEvent", function(param1) {
				console.log("Triggered! " + param1);

				// Triggers "MyAwesomeAnswer" on Lua
				Events.Call("MyAwesomeAnswer", "Hey there!");
			})
		</script>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello World!
    </body>
</html>
```

It will output on screen:

![WebUI results](/img/docs/user-interface.webp)

And also output on the console:

```text
[WebUI]  Triggered! Hello! You are ready!
[Script] Received an answer! Message: Hey there!
```

## Widget

Another very flexible way of creating UIs is using the new <Classes.Widget /> Class! With them you can have all access to the powerful Widgets and even create your own through Unreal Engine and import them in-game, providing a seamless User Experience!

## Canvas

One last way to plot data on the screen is to use the <Classes.Canvas /> Class:
