nanos world [**Store**](https://store.nanos.world) is the platform on which you are invited to share your **Game-Modes**, **Packages** and **Assets** with the nanos world community!

![](/img/docs/store.jpg)


## About the Store

In the Store, you can upload your Assets, Packages, release new versions, create Teams and much more! It is 100% integrated with [Vault](vault) and the [CLI](/core-concepts/server-manual/nanos-world-cli.mdx)!

:::info

The Store and the Vault are still under development. We are launching small usable pieces of it to build and improve it with you!

:::


## Server Authorization Token

In order to be able to use the CLI, now you must provide an **Authorization Token** in the `Config.toml` or passing with `--token` command line.

This token is used to authenticate your user and the rights to download the Assets/Packages.


### Generating a new Token

To generate a new token, go to the Store, under your **Profile Name**, then on **Settings**, or click on [this link](https://store.nanos.world/settings/tokens/).

![](/img/docs/store-02.jpg)

In that page, you can manage your active tokens and create new ones.

![](/img/docs/store-03.jpg)

When creating a new one, you can specify a label (only you will see it) and an expiration time. The maximum time is 2 years.

Once you create it, copy the token as save it, you won't be able to restore it if you lose it.

And you are done! Now just copy and paste your token into your `Config.toml` and you are authenticated to run CLI commands!


## Teams

Teams are group of users and are the "holders" of the Resources (Assets/Packages) in the Store.

Currently they can only be created during the Upload of a new Resource.

Once created, they can be modified under your Profile/Teams tab or at [this link](https://store.nanos.world/teams/). You can add more members, check all uploaded resources and edit it's information.

## Releases & Versions

nanos world Store counts on a Release/Version system, which you can upload new versions of your Resource. You can upload versions as Private, Beta, Alpha and Stable and also add a Changelog to it.

## Uploading new Resources

Uploading a [Package](https://store.nanos.world/packages/create/) or an [Asset Pack](https://store.nanos.world/assets/create/) through the UI is very straight. In the upload page, you can define the **Package Name** (must be unique, following the correct pattern - this is the folder name), the **Team**, **Title**, and customize the **Descriptions**!

You must upload a **.zip** file with all content your or Package or Asset Pack, as it follows:


### Guidelines

1. Remember to delete the hidden `.cache` files if you have them in your Package and Assets folders!
2. Set the correct **version** in the `Package.toml` or `Assets.toml`!
3. Your `.zip` must contain the file `Package.toml` or `Assets.toml` in the root of it.


### Categories & Tags

During the creation of your Resource, you can set the Categories and Tags to customize it.

The **Tags** are used mainly for categorization and (*soon*) searches. And the **Categories** are used differently depending if it's a Package or an Asset Pack:

* **Package**: Categories are used as the type of the Package (game-mode, script, loading-screen).
* **Asset Pack**: Categories are used just like a more specific Tag.


## Store API

You can download, upload and edit your resources through HTTPS requests, check it the Swagger documentation at https://api.nanos.world/store/docs. More tutorials coming soonâ„¢.


## Automate GitHub Releases

If your Package or Asset Pack is uploaded to the GitHub, you can make use of our [Official Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nanos-store-action) to automate the upload of new releases!

For that, first create a `.yml` file inside your repository at `.github/workflows/`. E.g.: `./github/workflows/nanos-world-store.yml` with the content:

```yml
name: nanos world Store Publish

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Publish package
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Nanos Store Action
        uses: nanos-world/nanos-store-action@v1.0
        with:
          # folder which contains the asset/package - if it's on root, leave it blank
          folder: ''
          # name of the asset/package
          name: 'name-of-the-package-or-asset'
          # changelog of the release - can be edited on the store before it gets published
          changelog: 'built through actions'
          # API token - generate at https://store.nanos.world/settings/tokens/ and set under Settings -> Secrets -> Actions with name STORE_SECRET
          token: ${{ secrets.STORE_SECRET }}
```

:::tip

The `folder` must be filled if in your repository the Package/Assets.toml is located inside a subfolder.

The `name` should be set to your Package or Asset Pack folder name.

The `changelog` can be left with a default value for now as it's a required field.

The `token` should be generated at https://store.nanos.world/settings/tokens/ and set under your *GitHub Settings -> Secrets -> Actions* with name `STORE_SECRET`.

:::

Then, on every **release** on your GitHub, it will trigger and publish the new version as **draft**.

So after that, go to your Releases page of your resource: https://store.nanos.world/, edit the changelog and publish it.
